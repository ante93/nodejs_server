1.0.0 / 2016-11-01
------------------

After five years of development, we finally have reach the 1.0.0 milestone! Big thanks goes
to [Ryan Zim](https://github.com/RyanZim) for leading the charge on this release!

### Added
- `walkSync()`

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: dropped Node v0.10 support.
- disabled `rimaf` globbing, wasn't used. [#280]
- deprecate `copy()/copySync()` option `filter` if it's a `RegExp`. `filter` should now be a function.
- inline `rimraf`. This is temporary and was done because `rimraf` depended upon the beefy `glob` which `fs-extra` does not use. [#300]

### Fixed
- bug fix proper closing of file handle on `utimesMillis()` [#271]
- proper escaping of files with dollar signs [#291]
- `copySync()` failed if user didn't own file. [#199], [#301]


0.30.0 / 2016-04-28
-------------------
- Brought back Node v0.10 support. I didn't realize there was still demand. Official support will end **2016-10-01**.

0.29.0 / 2016-04-27
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed support for Node v0.10. If you still want to use Node v0.10, everything should work except for `ensureLink()/ensureSymlink()`. Node v0.12 is still supported but will be dropped in the near future as well.

0.28.0 / 2016-04-17
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed `createOutputStream()`. Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-output-stream. See: [#192][#192]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` check for invalid win32 path chars. See: [#209][#209], [#237][#237]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` if drive not mounted, error. See: [#93][#93]

0.27.0 / 2016-04-15
-------------------
- add `dereference` option to `copySync()`. [#235][#235]

0.26.7 / 2016-03-16
-------------------
- fixed `copy()` if source and dest are the same. [#230][#230]

0.26.6 / 2016-03-15
-------------------
- fixed if `emptyDir()` does not have a callback: [#229][#229]

0.26.5 / 2016-01-27
-------------------
- `copy()` with two arguments (w/o callback) was broken. See: [#215][#215]

0.26.4 / 2016-01-05
-------------------
- `copySync()` made `preserveTimestamps` default consistent with `copy()` which is `false`. See: [#208][#208]

0.26.3 / 2015-12-17
-------------------
- fixed `copy()` hangup in copying blockDevice / characterDevice / `/dev/null`. See: [#193][#193]

0.26.2 / 2015-11-02
-------------------
- fixed `outputJson{Sync}()` spacing adherence to `fs.spaces`

0.26.1 / 2015-11-02
-------------------
- fixed `copySync()` when `clogger=true` and the destination is read only. See: [#190][#190]

0.26.0 / 2015-10-25
-------------------
- extracted the `walk()` function into its own module [`klaw`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw).

0.25.0 / 2015-10-24
-------------------
- now has a file walker `walk()`

0.24.0 / 2015-08-28
-------------------
- removed alias `delete()` and `deleteSync()`. See: [#171][#171]

0.23.1 / 2015-08-07
-------------------
- Better handling of errors for `move()` when moving across devices. [#170][#170]
- `ensureSymlink()` and `ensureLink()` should not throw errors if link exists. [#169][#169]

0.23.0 / 2015-08-06
-------------------
- added `ensureLink{Sync}()` and `ensureSymlink{Sync}()`. See: [#165][#165]

0.22.1 / 2015-07-09
-------------------
- Prevent calling `hasMillisResSync()` on module load. See: [#149][#149].
Fixes regression that was introduced in `0.21.0`.

0.22.0 / 2015-07-09
-------------------
- preserve permissions / ownership in `copy()`. See: [#54][#54]

0.21.0 / 2015-07-04
-------------------
- add option to preserve timestamps in `copy()` and `copySync()`. See: [#141][#141]
- updated `graceful-fs@3.x` to `4.x`. This brings in features from `amazing-graceful-fs` (much cleaner code / less hacks)

0.20.1 / 2015-06-23
-------------------
- fixed regression caused by latest jsonfile update: See: https://github.com/jprichardson/node-jsonfile/issues/26

0.20.0 / 2015-06-19
-------------------
- removed `jsonfile` aliases with `File` in the name, they weren't documented and probably weren't in use e.g.
this package had both `fs.readJsonFile` and `fs.readJson` that were aliases to each other, now use `fs.readJson`.
- preliminary walker created. Intentionally not documented. If you use it, it will almost certainly change and break your code.
- started moving tests inline
- upgraded to `jsonfile@2.1.0`, can now pass JSON revivers/replacers to `readJson()`, `writeJson()`, `outputJson()`

0.19.0 / 2015-06-08
-------------------
- `fs.copy()` had support for Node v0.8, dropped support

0.18.4 / 2015-05-22
-------------------
- fixed license field according to this: [#136][#136] and https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.10.0

0.18.3 / 2015-05-08
-------------------
- bugfix: handle `EEXIST` when clobbering on some Linux systems. [#134][#134]

-------------------
- bugfix: allow `F_OK` ([#120][#120])

0.18.1 / 2015-04-15
-------------------
- improved windows support for `move()` a bit. https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/92838980f25dc2ee4ec46b43ee14d3c4a1d30c1b
- fixed a lot of tests for Windows (appveyor)

0.18.0 / 2015-03-31
-------------------
- added `emptyDir()` and `emptyDirSync()`

0.17.0 / 2015-03-28
-------------------
- `copySync` added `clobber` option (before always would clobber, now if `clobber` is `false` it throws an error if the destination exists).
**Only works with files at the moment.**
- `createOutputStream()` added. See: [#118][#118]

0.16.5 / 2015-03-08
-------------------
- fixed `fs.move` when `clobber` is `true` and destination is a directory, it should clobber. [#114][#114]

0.16.4 / 2015-03-01
-------------------
- `fs.mkdirs` fix infinite loop on Windows. See: See https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/pull/74 and https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/issues/66

0.16.3 / 2015-01-28
-------------------
- reverted https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/1ee77c8a805eba5b99382a2591ff99667847c9c9


0.16.2 / 2015-01-28
-------------------
- fixed `fs.copy` for Node v0.8 (support is temporary and will be removed in the near future)

0.16.1 / 2015-01-28
-------------------
- if `setImmediate` is not available, fall back to `process.nextTick`

0.16.0 / 2015-01-28
-------------------
- bugfix `fs.move()` into itself. Closes #104
- bugfix `fs.move()` moving directory across device. Closes #108
- added coveralls support
- bugfix: nasty multiple callback `fs.copy()` bug. Closes #98
- misc fs.copy code cleanups

0.15.0 / 2015-01-21
-------------------
- dropped `ncp`, imported code in
- because of previous, now supports `io.js`
- `graceful-fs` is now a dependency

0.14.0 / 2015-01-05
-------------------
- changed `copy`/`copySync` from `fs.copy(src, dest, [filters], callback)` to `fs.copy(src, dest, [options], callback)` [#100][#100]
- removed mockfs tests for mkdirp (this may be temporary, but was getting in the way of other tests)

0.13.0 / 2014-12-10
-------------------
- removed `touch` and `touchSync` methods (they didn't handle permissions like UNIX touch)
- updated `"ncp": "^0.6.0"` to `"ncp": "^1.0.1"`
- imported `mkdirp` => `minimist` and `mkdirp` are no longer dependences, should now appease people who wanted `mkdirp` to be `--use_strict` safe. See [#59]([#59][#59])

0.12.0 / 2014-09-22
-------------------
- copy symlinks in `copySync()` [#85][#85]

0.11.1 / 2014-09-02
-------------------
- bugfix `copySync()` preserve file permissions [#80][#80]

-------------------
- upgraded `"ncp": "^0.5.1"` to `"ncp": "^0.6.0"`
- upgrade `jsonfile": "^1.2.0"` to `jsonfile": "^2.0.0"` => on write, json files now have `\n` at end. Also adds `options.throws` to `readJsonSync()`
